## Bachelor's Pasta (aka Pasta a la Gidon) :man_cook:
[](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/#basic-syntax)

Gidon Ben Bag was an artist born in France who worked and lived on Kibbutz Ein Hashofet, where I met him. He was my friend. And when I was down and low, he invited me to his humble home where he prepared what he called his "bachelor's pasta": a simple, comfort food. Quick and cozy, I hope it cheers you up too! Let me know what you think.

**Prep Time**: 10 min.
**Cook Time**: 40 min. [^1]  
**Total Time**: 50 min

**Wine Pairing: :wine_glass:** A simple red table wine. Gidon served it with one that was literally called *Yaayin Shulchan* - table wine that cost 10 shekeles in the local market. It was perfect! If you want to get fancy (and delicious!) I recommend a robust Italian wine like :wine_glass: [Remy's Gold Star Super Tuscan] [^2] (https://remywines.com/shop/)
  
[^1]: I like to think of this is sit down, put your feet up with a glass of wine time. It can be longer than 30 min.
[^2]: I don't get royalties, but I get joy by promoting Remy wines, because Remy is awesome.

## Ingredients :tomato:
Quantities are very approximate. Use what you have and what you like more of, use more of. Don't like it? Leave it out.
 - 4 medium or 1 can (28 oz. diced) tomatoes, grossly diced 
 - 3 Tbsp good olive oil 4 garlic cloves
 - 1 large onion, coarsely sliced and qartered
 - Optional upgrade: Sliced vegetarian sausages
 - 1 package of pasta (spaghetti, penne, fusilli - whatever you have)
 - Seasonings: salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, oregano to taste
 
### Preparation
1. In a large pot, boil sufficient water for pasta.
2. Turn on oven to very hot, like, $400^\circ$
3. In a large pan, combine all the vegetables, olive oil, (and veg sausages if using). Mix with your hands. It's fun and feels good.
4. Add seasoning as desired and put the pan in the oven.
5. Sit back and enjoy your wine for 30 min. Read a book or call a friend.
6. Time to make the pasta: add salt to the pot like you want to re-create ocean water. Add pasta and cook to just under the time recommended on the package.
7. Strain pasta, combine with all the stuff from the pan
8. Serve with freshly grated parm and more wine.

## Notes
### Up your game
You can preserve 1 cup or so of the pasta liquid and combine it in a pan with the roasted vegetable mixture, stirring over medium heat until most of the liquid evaporates. My teenage son calls this "pasta sauce 101". Sure, it's better. The other way is delicious too. Just depends what you're in the mood for and how many pots you care to clean. 
### Additional ingredients you can include in the pan
Capers. Anchovies. Red, yellow or orange peppers. Artichoke hearts. More garlic. Always more garlic. Basil.
